"""Levain activation — SessionStart hook (Codex adapter).

Layer A (primacy) + Layer D (the start-catch half).

Wired to Codex's SessionStart event (matcher = startup|resume|clear|compact
per hooks.json). Injects, at primacy position:

  1. The starter posture string from activation/posture.md — the auto-opener
     that stands in for a hand-typed session opener.
  2. Operator-local date and time — models have no clock.
  3. On a genuinely fresh session (source ∈ {"startup", "clear"}) only: a
     wrap-check flag if the previous session left episodes unwrapped, AND the
     time-based prospective surface — open spores that have gone dormant or
     whose `next` date has arrived, surfaced once so nothing rots silently.
     `resume` and `compact` carry ongoing work, not a fresh start — they get
     posture re-injection but skip the wrap-check and the due-spore surface.

Codex SessionStart `source` vocabulary per Codex 0.133 schema: `startup`,
`resume`, `clear`, `compact`. (`clear` and `compact` mirror Claude Code's
parallel source values; empirical observation on Codex 0.132 saw only
`startup` and `resume` — the matcher now covers all four for forward
compatibility.)

FAIL-OPEN — structural: main()'s entire body is wrapped in a catch-all and
the process always exits 0. A hook must never crash or write stderr noise
into the operator's session. The _levain_hook import is guarded too, since
it runs before main() and a catch-all inside main() cannot cover it.
