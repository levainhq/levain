"""Levain activation — SessionStart hook.

Layer A (primacy) + Layer D (the start-catch half).

Wired to Claude Code's SessionStart event (startup | resume | clear | compact).
Injects, at primacy position:

  1. The starter posture string from activation/posture.md — the auto-opener
     that stands in for a hand-typed session opener.
  2. Operator-local date and time — models have no clock.
  3. On a genuinely fresh session (startup | clear) only: a wrap-check flag if
     the previous session left episodes unwrapped, AND the time-based
     prospective surface — open spores that have gone dormant or whose `next`
     date has arrived, surfaced once so nothing rots silently. `resume` and
     `compact` both carry ongoing work, not a fresh start — they get posture
     re-injection but skip the wrap-check and the due-spore surface. (`compact`
     is the most important re-injection case: compaction rebuilds the context
     window and the primacy posture goes with it.)

FAIL-OPEN — structural: main()'s entire body is wrapped in a catch-all and the
process always exits 0. A hook must never crash or write stderr noise into the
operator's session. The _levain_hook import is guarded too, since it runs
before main() and a catch-all inside main() cannot cover it.
