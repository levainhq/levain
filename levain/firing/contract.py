"""levain.firing.contract — the afferent-only firing contract (relocated from ``vagus.firing``).

The harness-neutral seam every firing-adapter (Claude Code hooks, Codex hooks, the
OpenHands ``VagusCondenser``) implements: **inject / capture / drift-defense**.

Afferent-only by construction — it perceives and recalls into the agent's OWN context
(ungated), captures raw episodes (an untrusted append, never the gated consolidate), and
carries the drift-defense directive. It NEVER acts outward and NEVER consolidates. That
constraint is the constitution (flow ``projects/vagus/brief.md``) compiled into the
contract's shape.

Adapters depend on the ``FiringContract`` PROTOCOL (a stable seam), never on anneal
directly — an anti-corruption layer, so anneal can churn without breaking N adapters.

A ``FiringContract`` is live *behavior*, not serializable *state*. An adapter that must
survive ``fork()`` / reload (both round-trip through serialization) cannot carry a live
handle — it must rebuild the firing from a serializable KIND. So firings register under a
kind (:func:`register_firing`) and are rebuilt via :func:`build_firing`. (Apparatus
HIGH-1: a live handle in a ``PrivateAttr`` is silently dropped on the serialize→validate
that fork performs.)

Slice 1 ships the protocol + a STUB implementation (``StubFiring``, kind ``"stub"``) with
a real trusted-context *shape* and stubbed recall *content*. Real anneal wiring
(``retrieve_patterns`` / ``retrieve_episodes``, in-process) registers a new kind behind
the same ``inject`` signature later — the dependency-isolated leaf stays anneal-only.

# constant is the ONE per-turn drift-defense surface it has. Spore-296 (package locus, Phill
# 2026-07-10) folds the rich directives in HERE, not into the entity seed: the drift-defense is

# the shared template's block bodies, extracted by the REAL ``_levain_hook.read_blocks`` (``canonical
# _object_model_plus_replaceable_surfaces``: one directive set, two injection surfaces — the hook and
# the condenser — kept in sync so a template improvement lifts BOTH). The lock is over the package
# DEFAULTS (both shipped in the wheel); a per-entity operator editing their own installed copy is
# expected + ungoverned. We carry the GENERIC shared set (broad cross-model failure classes), NOT the
